Hello from Sheri Allen,

Outside of work I spend my time mentoring the robotics program in my small town.  My husband and I have 2 boys.  My oldest son is a gifted builder of Legos and robots of many kinds...he doesn't think much of coding.  My youngest son is the software guy.  He loves the aspect of coding...he doesn't think much of building.  Genetics are great right!  I've been a DBA for many years....I love my work.  My goals are to always grow and be a great asset to my company.  Looking forward to diving in!
